# ISS-Horizon v0.1.1

Maintenance release focused on setup UX, naming consistency, and release/readability polish.

## Highlights

- Human-readable location resolution to coordinates + IANA timezone.
- ISS visibility prediction with configurable constraints (elevation, twilight, sunlit state, minimum window duration).
- Monthly reporting in plain text and browser-friendly HTML (`--html-out`).
- SMTP email delivery (HTML + plain-text fallback) and unattended monthly execution support.
- Interactive setup command (`iss-horizon setup`) for safer and faster configuration.

## Added

- Release process assets for consistent publishing:
  - `docs/release-checklist.md`
  - `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`
- README release discoverability improvements:
  - Releases badge
  - Explicit CI badge target (`main`)
  - Dedicated Releases section

## Changed

- Version alignment to `0.1.1` in project metadata/runtime constants.
- README installation guidance now includes `pipx install iss-horizon` for global CLI usage.
- Prominent security warning in README for secret handling and systemd env file usage.

## Operational improvements

- CelesTrak fetch hardening in restricted environments (resilient endpoint handling, explicit HTTP headers, fallback behavior).
- Setup wizard can suggest `ISS_LOCATION` from IP-based geolocation when no value exists.

## Upgrade notes

- If upgrading from `0.1.0`, verify your env config includes all required SMTP fields and `ISS_LOCATION`.
- Keep secrets out of VCS. For unattended runs, use `/etc/iss-horizon/iss-horizon.env` with systemd.

## CLI examples

```bash
iss-horizon next --location "Natal, RN, Brazil" --hours 48
iss-horizon month --location "Natal, RN, Brazil" --year 2026 --month 3 --html-out report.html
iss-horizon setup --env-file .env --test-email
```

## Limitations

- Predictions depend on TLE freshness/source availability.
- Local obstructions, weather, and light pollution are not modeled.

## Security reminder

- Never commit `.env` files or SMTP credentials.
- Use `/etc/iss-horizon/iss-horizon.env` for production/systemd deployments.
